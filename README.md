# Photo Categorization

This project was my final project for CS165B in Summer 2020. 
The code identifies pictures by using SIFT features and then using a classifier to identify what photo category it is.
The dataset to run the data is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/137RyRjvTBkBiIfeYBNZBtViDHQ6_Ewsp/view
